## Summary of Code Samples

### Data Wrangling 
This code sample involves cleaning and merging two separate data files about total employment by industry within a given U.S. state over time. The end result is a clean dataframe that can be used for further analysis or visualization. 

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
This code sample parses a sample press release and assigns sentiments to each word using three different libraries (nrc, afinn, and bing). Three plots are produced that provide visualizations of the overall sentiment of the press release according to each library. 

### Plotting 
This code sample takes a cleaned dataframe from the NYC Open Data portal. The dataframe includes information on demographic information and home broadband uptake by ZIP code. This script uses the shapefiles in the folder to produce a chloropleth that describes home broadband uptake in each ZIP code across New York City.
